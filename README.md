This project was the result of my investigation into using portals to create non-euclidean spaces. After doing some reasearch and utilising the tutorials of Lim Ding Wen to help create the basic portal framework, as well as utilising a minor element of Sebastian Lague's portal tutorial (the custom shader for object slicing), I updated, modified, and expanded the frameworks, creating various types of portals and interactions between them, such as making linking portals of different sizes possible, creating portals which only function under certain conditions (such as the player walking through them backwards), and portals which change their destination upon being used.
